# Brief Description - Sports team manager.
    This project serves as a sports team manager application.
    It enables users to input player names and their roles within a football team. 
    This application also allows user to login, edit and delete their input from the database and to upload files to our system for creating their dream team.
    The implementation involves the utilization of two tables hosted on an AWS Server to store and output the input values.
